Ricardo-CommandServer

Hello. This provides a command server to interract with the ricardo-backend. It provides two user interfaces, either a rest api served by flask, or a command line interface. A basic send_command_packet always exists. New commands are written in python using the @CommandServer.register(command_name) decorator and are automatically added as rest api endpoints and callable commands. Custom argparsers can be passed to. It communicates with the backend over socketio.
